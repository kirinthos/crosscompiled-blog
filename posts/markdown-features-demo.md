### HTML Support

You can also use HTML tags when needed:

This is a custom HTML block with inline styling.
</div>

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

This content is hidden by default and can be expanded by clicking the summary.

</details>

## Escaping Characters

If you need to display literal markdown characters, escape them with
backslashes:

\*This text is not italic\*

\`This is not code\`

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive headers** to organize your content
2. **Include code examples** when writing technical posts
3. **Use tables** for structured data comparison
4. **Add task lists** for tutorials or step-by-step guides
5. **Include links** to relevant resources
6. **Use blockquotes** for important notes or quotes

## Conclusion

This blog supports all standard markdown features plus GitHub Flavored Markdown
extensions. The combination of markdown simplicity with the power of React and
Next.js makes it easy to create rich, engaging blog posts.

Happy writing! ðŸš€
