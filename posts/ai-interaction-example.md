# AI Interaction Example

This post demonstrates how to use the new AI-focused callout types to document
your interactions with AI assistants.

## A Typical AI Development Session

Here's how I might document working with an AI on a coding problem:

> [!prompt] I need to create a function that validates email addresses. It
> should return true for valid emails and false for invalid ones. Can you help
> me write this in JavaScript?

> [!robot] Here's a JavaScript function that validates email addresses using a
> regular expression:
>
> ```javascript
> function validateEmail(email) {
>   const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
>   return emailRegex.test(email);
> }
> ```

> [!thought] The AI gave me a basic regex, but I know email validation can be
> tricky. Let me ask for something more robust.

> [!prompt] That's a good start, but I've heard email validation regex can be
> complex. Can you give me a more comprehensive solution that handles edge
> cases?

> [!robot] You're absolutely right! Email validation is notoriously complex.
> Here's a more robust approach:
>
> ```javascript
> function validateEmail(email) {
>   // Basic format check
>   const basicRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
>   if (!basicRegex.test(email)) return false;
>
>   // Length checks (RFC 5321)
>   if (email.length > 254) return false;
>   const [local, domain] = email.split("@");
>   if (local.length > 64) return false;
>
>   return true;
> }
> ```

> [!success] Much better! This handles the common edge cases while keeping the
> code readable.

## When to Use These Callouts

### Use `[!prompt]` for:

- Your questions to AI assistants
- Instructions you give to AI tools
- Documenting your thought process when asking for help
- Showing the "human input" side of AI interactions

### Use `[!robot]` for:

- AI responses and suggestions
- Code generated by AI
- Automated system outputs
- Any machine-generated content you want to highlight

## Benefits

> [!info] These callouts help readers understand the collaborative nature of
> AI-assisted development. They make it clear what came from human insight
> versus AI assistance.

> [!tip] Both prompt and robot callouts use monospace fonts, making them perfect
> for technical discussions and code examples.
