# Adding Patreon

Alright, let's add a Patreon link to this page!

[CrossCompiled Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CrossCompiled)

It's getting harder to report the robot's speech due to the massive amount of
thinking GPT-5 does...let me see if I can extract some of this content.

Uh oh. I hate it when it tries to make it's own SVGs...let's provide it with the
patreon icon instead and correct its course.

Looks great after that download...except the icon is small as shit. I opened it
in an image editor and cropped the image size to the content and now it looks
fine.

If you would consider supporting the page, I'd appreciate it! Supporting tells
me that this content I'm developing is worth something and I should continue!
