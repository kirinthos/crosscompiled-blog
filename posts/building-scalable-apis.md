# Building Scalable APIs: Lessons Learned

Over the years, I've worked on numerous API projects that started small but
eventually needed to handle significant scale and complexity. Here are some key
lessons I've learned about building APIs that can grow with your needs.

## 1. Design for Consistency

Consistency is crucial for API adoption and maintenance. Establish clear
conventions early:

### URL Structure

```
GET    /api/v1/users          # List users
GET    /api/v1/users/123      # Get specific user
POST   /api/v1/users          # Create user
PUT    /api/v1/users/123      # Update user
DELETE /api/v1/users/123      # Delete user
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-10T10:30:00Z",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

## 2. Implement Proper Error Handling

Clear error responses help developers integrate with your API effectively:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid input data",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "message": "Email format is invalid"
      }
    ]
  },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "req_123456789",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-10T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## 3. Plan for Versioning

API versioning is essential for backward compatibility:

- **URL Versioning**: `/api/v1/users` vs `/api/v2/users`
- **Header Versioning**: `Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=1`
- **Query Parameter**: `/api/users?version=1`

I prefer URL versioning for its simplicity and clarity.

## 4. Implement Rate Limiting

Protect your API from abuse and ensure fair usage:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1609459200
```

## 5. Use Caching Strategically

Implement caching at multiple levels:

- **Browser Caching**: Use appropriate `Cache-Control` headers
- **CDN Caching**: Cache static or semi-static responses
- **Application Caching**: Cache expensive database queries
- **Database Caching**: Use query result caching

## 6. Monitor and Log Everything

Comprehensive monitoring helps you understand usage patterns and identify
issues:

```javascript
// Example logging middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();

  res.on("finish", () => {
    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    logger.info({
      method: req.method,
      url: req.url,
      status: res.statusCode,
      duration,
      userAgent: req.get("User-Agent"),
      ip: req.ip,
    });
  });

  next();
});
```

## 7. Secure by Default

Security should be built in from the start:

- **Authentication**: Use JWT or OAuth 2.0
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control
- **HTTPS**: Always use TLS in production
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries

## 8. Document Thoroughly

Good documentation is crucial for API adoption:

- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Generate interactive documentation
- **Examples**: Provide request/response examples
- **SDKs**: Consider providing client libraries
- **Changelog**: Document all changes

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

- Use database indexes effectively
- Implement connection pooling
- Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads

### Pagination

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20,
    "total": 150,
    "total_pages": 8,
    "next_page": "/api/v1/users?page=2",
    "prev_page": null
  }
}
```

### Async Processing

For long-running operations, use async patterns:

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_123456",
  "status": "processing",
  "status_url": "/api/v1/jobs/job_123456"
}
```

## Conclusion

Building scalable APIs requires thoughtful planning and consistent execution.
Start with solid foundations in design, security, and monitoring, then iterate
based on real usage patterns and feedback.

The key is to balance current needs with future flexibility - over-engineering
early can be just as problematic as under-engineering. Focus on getting the
fundamentals right, then scale and optimize as needed.
