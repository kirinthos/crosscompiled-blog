# Welcome to CrossCompiled Blog

Hello and welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share this space with you where
I'll be writing about software development, engineering practices, and various
technology topics that interest me.

## What You Can Expect

This blog will cover a wide range of topics including:

- **Software Architecture**: Design patterns, system design, and architectural
  decisions
- **Programming Languages**: Deep dives into different languages and their
  ecosystems
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: CI/CD, containerization, cloud platforms, and
  deployment strategies
- **Best Practices**: Code quality, testing, documentation, and team
  collaboration
- **Technology Reviews**: Analysis of new tools, frameworks, and technologies

## About the Blog Setup

This blog is built with modern web technologies:

- **Next.js** for static site generation
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Markdown** for content authoring
- **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment
- **AWS S3** for hosting

The entire setup is designed to be simple and efficient - I can just write
markdown files, push to GitHub, and the blog automatically updates!

## Markdown Features

This blog supports all standard markdown features plus GitHub Flavored Markdown:
